# Forked from ArcoLinuxD Gnome desktop

This is a continual work in progress to try to create as close to an automated setup as I can.

# Installation Process


This is NOT a silent install

you will be asked several questions as it progresses



Run the ArcoLinuxD Iso to install the Arch framework.

Run these commands in this order:


git clone https://github.com/Vicck-tech/arco-gnome

chmod +x ~/arco-gnome/*.sh 

cd arco-gnome

./arcosetup.sh


# Thanks

I want to thank Erik Dubois and the ArcoLinux team for the countless hours he/they have put in to bring us such an incredably stunning and stable distro. I have learned so much from his youtube videos and the content on his websites. Thanks so much
